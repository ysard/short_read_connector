Description: Tool that enables the comparisons of two read sets
 Short read connector enables the comparisons of two read sets B and Q. 
 For each read from Q it provides either: * The number of occurrences of 
 each k-mers of the read in the set B (SRC_counter) or * A list of reads 
 from B that share enough k-mers with the (a window of) the tested read 
 from A (SRC_linker)
